# CH 07 README

create a new folder for each project and use it as a submodule inside git such that they can be tracked separately

as of December 12, 2023 -> working on PLAYLIST - Introduction to AWS Lambda with Python and SAM | YouTube as part of Exercises in chapter 7

most folders inside this folder will have their own github repo as each one will assist specific projects. eg: lambda functions on aws
